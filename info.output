Experience  Computational Biologist at Biocant - Technology Transfer Association  June 2012  -  September 2016  (4 years 4 months)  Computational Biologist to develop theoretical tools to be used to maximize the yield of   microorganism and of microbial bio-products of biotechnological interest.  The forecasting technique uses quantitative whole organism data and custom mathematical models   as a basis to identify optimal microbial metabolic solutions. It predicts the best culturing and genetic   conditions that maximizes the microbial function of interest: e.g., recombinant protein production;   maximal stress resistance; biomass yield.   Specifically, my responsabilities were:  1. Design and implementation of mathematical models for microorganism metabolism and growth,   based on Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae;  2. Parameterization of microbial models and definition of validation benchmarks. This required the   implementation of custom made Matlab routines/scripts to perform the following sub-tasks:   • High dimensional data retrieved through automatic database query;  • Calculation of genome-wide protein levels from raw mass spectrometry datafiles;  • Statistical correlations analysis among estimated biological parameters through R            programming;  3. Integration of theoretical models with optimization programs (GAMS) and algorithms (Knitro) to   simulate condition-dependent optimal metabolic configurations. Multidimensional parameter scan,   sensitivity and perturbation analysis to assess consistency of simulation results;  4. Periodic Presentations of results to international audiences and to projects collaborators.  Postdoctoral research grant recipient at Roma Tre University - Biology Dep - Biochemistry and  Cellular Physiology laboratories  September 2008  -  September 2011  (3 years 1 month)  Experimental Biologist, as part of a team, to identify new chemicals of plant origin with anti-  tumor effects and their impact on colon and breast cancer prevention. My role was the ex-novo   implementation of in vitro and ex-vivo drug screening procedures as well as the implementation of   cell culture tests.  1. Set up of in vitro drug screening protocols that uses recombinant hormone receptors as anti-  cancer drug target;  2. Set up of in vitro drug screening protocols that measure compounds binding to blood proteins.   This allows to predict compounds bio-availability, that is their ability to be delivered through the   blood;  3. Set up of ex vivo drug screening that uses cancer (HeLa) cell lines to directly quantify   compounds ability to enter the cell and to specifically interact with their molecular target;  4. Cell biology tests (e.g. cell co-stimulation, cell proliferation/cell death, XTT) and biochemical   assays (e.g. gene expression levels, cell labeling, immuno-precipitation, western blot) on different   cell lines to select chemicals with higher anti-cancer potency and to assess the effect of pollutants   (bisphenol A) on cancer growth. Cell signaling pathway analysis to study the underlying molecular   mechanisms.   research grant recipient at ‘Roma Tre’ University - Biology Dep - Biochemistry and Cellular  Physiology laboratories  September 2007  -  September 2008  (1 year 1 month)  Research fellowship for the research project entitled: “Interaction between Environmental Endocrine   Disruptors and Estrogen Receptors: Molecular basis and Cellular Pathway involved” working   in research team activities with the aim to define the ligand -dependent modulation of estrogen   receptor extranuclear mechanisms of action exerted by synthetic and natural compounds.

I focused on writing   REST APIs, Oracle PL/SQL procedures, SQL Loader scripts,  and Spring batches. Later, I started writing   Technical Design documents for the solutions Change Requests.  I was also engaged in pre-sales show-cases of platform/solutions in the IoT field, and I participated in writing   the technical section of Requests for Proposals (Solution Architecture with Use Cases).   My areas of interest are IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and Health.  Data Scientist at MR&D S.P.A.  dicembre 2015  -  settembre 2016 (10 mesi)  I worked on the development of algorithms for healthcare and fitness applications, that were aimed at   tracking the physical activity and performance using information extracted from inertial sensors placed on a   wearable device. In particular, I applied proper data pre-processing and pattern recognition methods in order   to achieve a near real-time feedback for the user. In addition, I implemented the chosen algorithms on an   Android platform for feedback and display purposes.  Android Developer, IT Consultant at ShadApps S.r.l.  marzo 2016  -  aprile 2016 (2 mesi)  I developed parts of many published Android applications; the implementations focused in particular   on consuming RESTful APIs, performing CRUD operations on a local DB, managing data transfer and   utilisation across the whole applications, and caching. In this scheme, I became familiar with libraries such   as Realm, Retrofit 2, Gson, Otto, Picasso, together with the native Android SDK.  I also served as consultant on topics related to security (both client and server sides) and data management.
